Tasks (tasks.json):\n   - Verify code quality, bugs, performance, and security\n   - Validate cron expressions and execution timing\n   - Check async handling for network operations\n   - Validate task naming conventions\n\n   The format of tasks.json is as follows\n\n   {\n      \"tasks\": [\n        {\n          \"cron_moy\": \"<cron_moy>\",\n          \"cron_hour\": \"<cron_hour>\",\n          \"cron_minute\": \"<cron_minute>\",\n          \"cron_dow\": \"<cron_dow>\",\n          \"cron_dom\": \"<cron_dom>\",\n          \"code\": \"<python_code>\",\n          \"task_name\": \"<task_name>\",\n          \"kwargs\": \"{}\",\n          \"enabled\": <boolean>\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n2. Fixtures (fixture.json):\n   - Review configuration changes\n   - Check for data integrity issues\n   - List affected database tables\n\n3. Templates (template/zcustom/*.html):\n   - Check template logic and syntax\n   - Review script security\n   - Validate HTML structure\n\n4. Views (view/**/*)\n   - ZelthyCustomView must be present and it must inherit a class to make sure that views are not publicly exposed\n   - Check response handling\n   - Review permission implementation:\n     * No unconditional access grants\n   - Raw SQL queries must never be used unless it's absolutely required, if it is used make sure that it is a read\n   - ensure that ZelthyCustomView subclasses a view from Zelthy1 library\n    - ZelthyCustomView can have a has_perm method to implement access_condition\n      or it can also use Zelthy1's native permissioning as specified below\n      class ZelthyCustomView(SetUpMixin, View):\n       \tpermission = 'doctor.view_doctormodel'\n    - ZelthyCustomView must never subclass any of django's generic views without subclassing SetupMixin as specified below\n    - Never grant unconditional access\n      class ZelthyCustomView(SetUpMixin, View): # incorrect, this should never be done\n     \t\t\tdef has_perm(self):\n      \t\t\t\treturn True\n    - Any operation that depends on network such as sending sms, email etc must be executed through asynchronous tasks\n\n5. Triggers (trigger/*):\n  - Make sure that the function with the given signature is defined\n    def zelthy_trigger(request, objects, *args):\n  - ignore the fact that the redirect function is not imported, assume that the import statement will be added later\n   - Check error handling\n   - Review performance implications\n\n6. Routes (meta_data.json):\n   - Validate route syntax\n   - Check for duplicates\n   - Verify regex patterns\n\n   the format of meta_data.json is\n\n   {\n      \"route\": [\n        {\n          \"regex\": \"<route_regex>\",\n          \"is_enabled\": <boolean>,\n          \"route_name\": \"<route_name>\",\n          \"view\": \"<view>\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n\n\n7. Security & Best Practices:\n   - No hardcoded secrets\n   - No hardcoded user details\n   - Optimize concurrent requests\n\n8. Manifest (manifest.json)\n   - Check if version is updated correctly\n   - make sure that a remark is added\n   - do not warn about missing tasks, fixture or config_script as they are optional\n\nImportant Notes:\n- Only return reviews if issues are found you must never return a description of changes or indicate that a review is not required\n- line must correspond to the line numbers in the patch\n- For deletions, use the line number before the deletion\n- For additions, use the new line number\n- Skip .github/ directory files\n- For multi-line issues, use the first line where the issue begins\n- Reviews should be specific and actionable\n- if there are no reviews you must return an empty string as review and set line to 0\n- You must use the file content only as a refernce to review the patch provided, you must not review the contents of the file\n\nExample Response:\n{\n  \"reviews\": [\n    {\n      \"review\": \"The cron expression '* * * * *' will run every minute, which may overload the system. Consider using a less frequent schedule like '0 * * * *' to run hourly instead.\",\n      \"line\": \"15\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n";
